Every time that a script (python or bash script) that use SADMIN Tools is run,
it produce a log, in the dedicated directory ${SADMIN}/log.
The name of the Log file "[HOSTNAME]_sadm_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].log".
Log are cumulative by default, but you can decide to overwrite the script log 
if you want.
In python your can set 'st.log_append = False' or 'SADM_LOG_APPEND="N"' in 
shell script to create a new log every time your script is started. 
SADM_MAX_LOGLINE represent the maximum number of lines you want to keep in each log file.
The log are automatically trimmed to this number at the end of your script.
This help us keeping our log to a reasonnable size.
Recommended size is 1000 as a starting point.
