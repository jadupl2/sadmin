#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every time a script (python or bash script) that use SADMIN Tools is run,
it produce a log, in the dedicated directory ${SADMIN}/log.
The name of the Log file is "[HOSTNAME]_sadm_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].log".
Log file are cumulative by default, but you can decide to overwrite the 
script log if you want.
The log are automatically trimmed to this number each time the script end.

This help keeping our log to a reasonnable size.
Recommended size is 1000 lines as a starting point.
