# sadmin.cfg SADM_MAX_RCHLINE Documentation
# Revise 2018_02_14
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a (python or shell) script using the SADMIN tools start and ends, 
it record the date/time and the ending status of your script in what we call
a RCH file ([R]eturn [C]ode [H]istory] file). 

     - The RCH file name are "[HOSTNAME]_sadm_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].rch"
     - They are located in the directory ${SADM_BASE_DIR}/dat/rch.
     - This number represent the maximum number of lines that each RCH file can contain.
     
Recommended value of 100 lines would keep an history of 50 days and is the default value.
