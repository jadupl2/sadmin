#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a (python or shell) script using the SADMIN tools start and ends, it 
record the date/time and the ending status in what we call a 
RCH file ([R]eturn [C]ode [H]istory] file.
The *.rch filename are "[HOSTNAME]_sadm_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].rch"
They are located in ${SADM_BASE_DIR}/dat/rch
You can use the "sadm_rch_scr_summary.sh" (You can also type "smon")
to display a summary of all "rch" files collected from the server farm.
Log are created/updated each time the function sadm_start() is called.
There is a log file per script, log are cumulative, they are never cleared
SADM_MAX_RCHLINE represent the maximum number of lines that each *.rch file
can contain. 
If your script is run daily, so value of 100 would keep an history 
of 50 days.
