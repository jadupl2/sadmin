# sadmin.cfg SADM_MAX_RCHLINE Documentation
# Revise 2018_02_14
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a (python or shell) script using the SADMIN tools start and ends, 
it record the date/time and the ending status in what we call a RCH file 
([R]eturn [C]ode [H]istory] file). 
The RCH file name are "[HOSTNAME]_sadm_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].rch"
They are located in the directory ${SADM_BASE_DIR}/dat/rch.
The RCH file are created/updated each time a script is started and ended.
The RCH file are automatically trimmed to this number each time the script end.
SADM_MAX_RCHLINE represent the maximum number of lines that each RCH file
can contain. 
A value of 100 would keep an history of 50 days and is the default value.
