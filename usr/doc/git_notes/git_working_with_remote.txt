SHOWING YOUR REMOTE
root@nomad/sadmin # git remote -v
origin	https://jadupl2@bitbucket.org/jadupl2/sadmin.git (fetch)
origin	https://jadupl2@bitbucket.org/jadupl2/sadmin.git (push)
root@nomad/sadmin # 

ADD REMOTE REPOSITORIES
$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)


FETCHING FROM REMOTE REPOSITORY
$ git fetch [remote-name]

The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. 
After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.

If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. 
So, git fetch origin fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. 
It’s important to note that the git fetch command pulls the data to your local repository – it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.


PUSHING TO REMOTE

root@nomad/sadmin # git push origin     DID NOT WORK BECAUSE SADM_LIB_SCREEN.SH WAS CHANGED SINCE WE CLONE AND WE ALSO CHANGE IT
To https://jadupl2@bitbucket.org/jadupl2/sadmin.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://jadupl2@bitbucket.org/jadupl2/sadmin.git'
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes before pushing again.  See the 'Note about
fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
