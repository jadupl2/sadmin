When running a python or shell script using the SADMIN tools, the start 
and the end date/time along with the ending status of your script is recorded
in what we call a 'RCH' file ([R]eturn [C]ode [H]istory]) file.
    - The name of the RCH file is "[HOSTNAME]_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].rch"
    - The RCH file is recorded in "${SADMIN}/dat/rch" directory.
    - RCH file are trim automatically at the end of script execution.
    - The number below is the maximum of lines you want to keep in each RCH file.
    - This help keeping our log to a reasonable size.    
    - The default value is 20 lines (0 = RCH file will not be trimmed)
