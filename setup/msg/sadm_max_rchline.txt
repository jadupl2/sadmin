When a (python or shell) script using the SADMIN tools start and ends, it 
record the date/time and the ending status of your script in what we call
a RCH file ([R]eturn [C]ode [H]istory]) file. 

    - The RCH file name are "[HOSTNAME]_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].rch"
    - They are located in the directory ${SADMIN}/dat/rch.
    - RCH file are trim automatically at the end of script execution.
    - It indicate the maximum of lines you want to keep in each RCH file.
    - This help keeping our log to a reasonnable size.     
    - The default value is 100 lines, this keep an history of ~50 days.
