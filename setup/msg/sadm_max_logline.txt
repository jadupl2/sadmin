Every time a script is run (python or shell script) that use SADMIN tools,
it produce a 'log' in the dedicated directory ${SADMIN}/log.
    - The name of the 'log' file is "[HOSTNAME]_[NAME_OF_SCRIPT].log".
    - Log file are cumulative by default, but it can be overridden if you want.
    - This number indicate the maximum of lines you want to keep in your log.
    - Log file are trim automatically at the end of script execution.
    - This help keeping our log to a reasonable size.
