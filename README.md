### How do I get set up? ###

* Simple to Setup 
  Create a Filesystem (or Directory) to store the SADMIN tools.
  Default (suggested) Directory (or filesystem) to extract the SADMIN Tools is /sadmin 
    - If you do not extract under /sadmin, you need to define an environment variable named SADMIN
      that contain the name of the directory you extract (Example export SADMIN=/MyDir).
  
* Configuration file is located in /sadmin/cfg - Edit this file after files extraction.
* Dependencies are check when running sadm_check_dependencies.sh in /sadmin/bin
