#   - These are the defaults values used by sadmin tools.
#   - Most fields can be overridden on a script basis
#        Some fields like SADM_ALERT_TYPE, SADM_MAIL_ADDR can be overridden 
#        in the SADMIN section at the top of script.
#        See template 'sadm_template.sh' & 'sadm_template.py' as an example.
#   - If this file 'sadmin.cfg' is not present when a script is executed,
#     then template file '.sadmin.cfg' will be copied to 'sadmin.cfg'.
#   - If both file 'sadmin.cfg' and '.sadmin.cfg' are not present, then  
#     default values are used.
