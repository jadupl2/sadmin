# Only include volume groups (opposite of EXCLUDE_VG).
# EXCLUDE_VG & EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS get automatically populated.

# Exclude Volume Group (and filesystem they include).
# EXCLUDE_VG=( datavg ) 

# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. 
# Added automatically to the $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array.

# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE is an array of strings that get written into a 
# backup-exclude.txt file used in 'tar -X backup-exclude.txt' to get 
# things excluded from the backup. 
# Proper quoting of the BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array members is crucial
# to avoid bash expansions. Example :
# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/d1/*' '/d2/*' ) 
# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/tmp/*' "$HOME/.cache" )

# Exclude components from being backed up,recreation information is active
# EXCLUDE_BACKUP=()

# Exclude components during the backup restore phase.
# Only used to exclude files from the restore. 
# EXCLUDE_RESTORE=()
