# Exclude Volume Group (and filesystem they include)

# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE is an array of strings that get written into a 
# backup-exclude.txt file used in 'tar -X backup-exclude.txt' to get 
# things excluded from the backup. 
# Proper quoting of the BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array members is crucial
# to avoid bash expansions. 
# In /etc/rear/site.conf use :
# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( "${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]}" '/d1/*' '/d2/*' ) 
# to specify your items that should be excluded from the backup 
# in addition to what gets excluded from the backup by default here 
#BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/tmp/*' '/var/tmp' "$HOME/.cache" )

# Exclude components from being backed up, 
# recreation information is active
#EXCLUDE_BACKUP=()

# Exclude components during the backup restore phase 
# Only used to exclude files from the restore.
