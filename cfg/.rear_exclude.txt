# SADMIN ReaR template exclude options v1.4

# Only include volume groups (opposite of EXCLUDE_VG)
# ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" "vg01" )

# EXCLUDE_VG=( datavg ) 


# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints
# Added automatically to the $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array

# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE is an array of strings that get written to 
# backup-exclude.txt file used in 'tar -X backup-exclude.txt' to
# get things excluded from the backup. 
# Proper quoting of the BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array members is crucial
# to avoid bash expansions. Example :
# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( ${BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE[@]} '/tmp/*' "$HOME/.cache" )


# Exclude components from being backed up,recreation information is active
